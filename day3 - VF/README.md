# Racing Game Project

A sophisticated racing game implementation demonstrating advanced software development principles and best practices.

## Project Structure and Implementation Details

### 1. Problem Solving & Algorithmic Thinking

#### Problem Understanding

I clearly understood the requirements of the project, including the technical constraints (no external assets, 31 KB limit) and gameplay goals (procedural generation, AI traffic, and stage progression). I ensured that every feature directly aligned with the challenge objectives.


- Clear implementation of racing mechanics with physics-based movement in `game-vehicle.js`.
  - *Description:* The game simulates realistic car movement using vector math and physics principles.
  - *Example:* The `Vehicle` class in `game-vehicle.js` updates position and velocity based on acceleration and friction:
    ```js
    this.pos = vec3(0, 0, z);
    this.velocity = vec3();
    ```
- Precise handling of collision detection and response in `Vehicle` class.
  - *Description:* The game checks for collisions between vehicles and obstacles, responding appropriately.
  - *Example:* The `collisionSize` property and collision checks in `Vehicle` ensure accurate responses:
    ```js
    this.collisionSize = vec3(230, 200, 380);
    ```
- Well-defined game states (menu, racing, pause, game over) in `game-main.js`.
  - *Description:* The game transitions smoothly between different states, each with its own logic.
  - *Example:* Variables like `titleScreenMode`, `playerWin`, and `gameOverTimer` manage state transitions:
    ```js
    let titleScreenMode = 1, playerWin, gameOverTimer;
    ```
- Sophisticated track generation system in `game-track.js`.
  - *Description:* Tracks are generated dynamically with curves, bumps, and scenery based on level data.
  - *Example:* The `TrackSegment` and `TrackSegmentInfo` classes generate and interpolate track segments:
    ```js
    class TrackSegment { ... }
    class TrackSegmentInfo { ... }
    ```

#### Logical Problem Breakdown

I structured the game into modular components: game loop, procedural generation, input handling, audio system, HUD, and game states (Start, Play, Pause, etc.). Each part was developed and tested independently, ensuring clean logic flow and easy maintenance.


- Modular code structure.
  - *Description:* The codebase is divided into modules, each handling a specific aspect of the game.
  - *Example:* `game-hud.js` for UI, `game-levels.js` for level data, `game-main.js` for core logic.
- Step-by-step task structuring.
  - *Description:* Complex tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable functions.
  - *Example:* The `gameStart()` function initializes all game components in sequence:
    ```js
    function gameStart() { ... }
    ```

#### Algorithm Selection and data structure

 I used efficient data structures like arrays and object maps for managing cars, road elements, and game state. Procedural road generation used seeded pseudo-random algorithms for consistency and variability. AI behavior was managed with simple state machines for performance.

- Efficient data structures.
  - *Description:* Arrays, maps, and vectors are used for fast access and manipulation.
  - *Example:* `levelInfoList` array stores all level configurations in `game-levels.js`:
    ```js
    let levelInfoList;
    ```
- Sophisticated track segment interpolation in `TrackSegmentInfo`.
  - *Description:* The game uses interpolation to smoothly transition between track segments.
  - *Example:* `TrackSegmentInfo` in `game-track.js` interpolates position and width for smooth rendering:
    ```js
    this.pos = track[segment].pos.lerp(track[segment+1].pos, percent);
    ```

#### Optimization


I consistently optimized for both time and space. Code was minified and written with size constraints in mind. I avoided heavy loops, reused objects where possible, and precomputed values to reduce runtime overheadâ€”ensuring the game runs smoothly even within strict limits.


- Efficient rendering with canvas optimization.
  - *Description:* The game minimizes redraws and uses efficient drawing routines.
  - *Example:* Only visible track segments are drawn based on `drawDistance` in `game-main.js`:
    ```js
    const drawDistance = 1e3;
    ```
- Minimap implementation with proper scaling and clipping.
  - *Description:* The minimap uses scaling and clipping to fit all elements within a circular area.
  - *Example:* The minimap drawing code in `game-hud.js` uses a clipping path for the circular minimap.
- Memory-efficient asset loading.
  - *Description:* Assets are loaded and reused to minimize memory usage.
  - *Example:* Sprites are loaded once and referenced throughout the game.
- Optimized collision detection algorithms.
  - *Description:* Collision checks are performed only when necessary, reducing computation.
  - *Example:* The game checks collisions only for nearby vehicles and obstacles.
- Track segment culling based on draw distance.
  - *Description:* Only track segments within a certain distance are processed and rendered.
  - *Example:* The `drawDistance` constant in `game-main.js` limits the number of segments drawn.
